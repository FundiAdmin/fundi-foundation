                                                    <p>Funds raised will go a long way to help us get students back to school.At least 139 schools were looted and vandalised during last monthâ€™s unrest. Among the schools that lost everything was Golden Steps, a special needs school, in Verulam, KZN.</p>
                                                    <p>The school was com-pletely ransacked, with looters taking everything from food and appliances to specialised computers and TVs designed to assist children with disabilities.</p>
                                                    <p>For many children in South Africa, school is so much more than just a place to learn. It is often where they receive their only nutritious meal of the day. It is a place of hope, long lasting friendships and big dreams.</p>
