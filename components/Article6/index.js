                                <h2>Matric Class of 2020 “wins” thanks to FundiFund marathon event</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Residents living close to Tembisa Secondary School were awakened by the sound of an air horn at 06h00 on Tuesday this week. The single blast not only signalled the beginning of the FundiFund 12-for-12 relay race, but was also a very real reminder of the race against time facing South Africa’s matrics in the countdown to their final exams.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With just over 1 050 000 matrics starting their end-of-year exams on 5 November 2020, the past three months have seen corporates, communities and education partners come together as never before to assist in #SavingTheClassOf2020.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This week’s FundiFund 12-for-12 relay race is one of these key initiatives. Seeking to raise funding to assist matrics with holistic exam preparation and support, this marathon event united team members across Fundi in donating their time – as amateur runners or organisers – or actively contributing their own funds towards the cause. All money raised in the build-up to the event, as well as beyond the day, will be donated to NGO Primestars. This will go towards Primestars’ national #SavingTheClassOf2020 initiative, which was launched in August in conjunction with the Department of Basic Education (DBE).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Everything we raise will be allocated to supporting matric learners across the country,” explains Mala Suriah, Fundi CMO and one of the marathon runners. “This will see pupils in need receive holistic support including study materials, books, food and refreshments, transport, online content (and free access to the content), as well as free WhatsApp access to exam preparation material, among others.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Primestars GM Nkosinathi Motshoana expressed appreciation to the runners and race supporters, and to the individuals, families, communities, associations and corporates who had already donated generously towards the cause: “Today’s race speaks to our collective future as a country. It’s about all of us coming together to do what we can to positively influence the outcome of the 2020 matric finals, and minimise the negative impact of Covid-19 on these learners and their futures.”

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Speaking at the event, Mr G L Mpahane, the Ekurhuleni North District Office Cluster Leader from the Department of Basic Education, thanked the runners for their commitment to #SavingTheClassOf2020: “Your commitment and preparation to getting here is truly inspirational. It is a fitting reminder of the courage and hard work of our matrics, and the far-reaching challenges so many of them have faced in the build-up to next week’s exams. We wish both you and them every success.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                With so much to run for, the Fundi and Primestars teams are encouraging contributors to continue giving. “We remain committed to shaping generations of South Africans through education opportunities that realise the full potential of our people and country,” says Suriah. “This race is just the beginning. Keep watching this space!”
