                                <p>
                                    18 July 2019, Kliprivier; Johannesburg South. Chief Marketing Officer of Fundi, Mala Suriah, has presented the Sibonile School for visually impaired learners with a cheque of R30 000. The funds will be used to upgrade the school’s conventional braille machines – directly impacting the quality of students’ learning and their learning experience. The donation speaks to Fundi’s brand promise of “know more. Be more” and its commitment to positively impact growth and career journeys of learners of diverse backgrounds across the country and throughout the continent

                                    Learners, teachers and parents at the Sibonile School for the visually impaired expressed their happiness and delight today – when education finance and education fund management solution specialist Fundi presented representatives with a cheque of R30 000. The donation was facilitated by Jicama 89, a registered NPO that works to support organisations to meet the needs of the less fortunate and able.

                                <p>
                                    Speaking at the event, Fundi’s CMO Mala Suriah acknowledged both Jicama 89 and the staff of Sibonile School for their commitment to enabling the potential of learners at the school. “As a brand that understands the uniqueness of education journeys, we wanted to find a meaningful way to assist these learners on their pathways towards success. With Sibonile providing such specialised learning to the students in its care, helping the school to purchase additional Tatrapoint braillers was an ideal initiative to support. The results will be experienced directly – and will have a real impact on learning and the learning experience.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Started in 1995 by (since retired) Principal Bafedi Moruthani, the Sibonile School has grown to accommodate 189 partially sighted, totally blind or deaf and blind learners. The children are taught and stay at the school, with the ultimate goal of their learning meaningful inclusion in their communities.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Jicama 89 has been supporting the school since 2007 when it first helped to build a separate girls’ hostel. It has since been involved in a variety of projects including providing specialised teaching equipment, uniforms, food and improving accommodation and classroom facilities, among others.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Jicama 89’s Project Director, Riccardo Fanfoni, explained that the long-term project to upgrade the school’s conventional braille machines to the more technically advanced Apex braille note-taking system and Tatrapoint braille system was a priority. “These systems have a positive educational impact for the learners and enhance their learning experience. Without donations from corporates such as Fundi, it would be a near impossible task to continue with this project.”                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With tailor-made learning solutions a core element of Fundi’s offering, Suriah highlighted the importance of inclusivity in learning – and accommodating unique learner needs. “This is something we remain committed to both in terms of how we custom-build our solutions and how we support organisations like Sibonile School and Jicama 89. We acknowledge and thank them for their exceptional contribution to this space and the lives they are touching and transforming through their work.”
